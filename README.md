Why Use a Framework?
--------------------------------

When developing web apps, the functionality gets complex quickly, both on the client and server side. You end up piling on some much functionality, maintaining and extending the software becomes nearly impossible if you haven't structured properly. Keeping code decoupled, properly-organized, and fully extensible is very time consuming, even with great project management. Without a framework promoting the use of good JS OOP coding patterns, the code can very quickly become a tangled mess!

Introduction to AirJS
---------------------------

Air JS makes web application development more realistic, organized, and clean. It's a command center where you can build the app from the ground up, call on resources that you've already built, and maintain a unified, organized, physical structure to your code.

Air JS facilitates a neat, object oriented, decoupled, "wireless" structure in web application engines and front-ends. 

The lightweight  framework facilitates maintainable code that is:

- structured neatly within an Object Oriented design
- decoupled, through Inversion of Control with Dependency Injection
- wireless via Relational Awareness and The Observer pattern

The framework features some powerful built-in components, allowing the developer to focus on his own components rather than reinvent the wheel for each new app.

Whether you use the framework to facilitate the production of your functionality from scratch, call on some of the framework's powerful built-in components, or employ some external libraries, Air JS will ensure that it's all done in a structured, maintainable way.

Air JS's Facilitated Patterns
-----------------------------
	
**The Observer Pattern:**
	
*The Observer is a design pattern where an object (known as a subject) maintains a list of objects depending on it (observers), automatically notifying them of any changes to state.*
		
**Dependency Injection:**
	
*Dependency injection is a software design pattern that implements inversion of control and allows a program design to follow the dependency inversion principle.*
	
**Single Function Function:**
	
*Instead of having a huge mess of callback hell, keep a single function to a single task, and do that task well. Sometimes you can get ahead of yourself and add more functionality within each function, but ask yourself: Can this become an independent function?*
