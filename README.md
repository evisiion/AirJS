Why Use a Framework?
--------------------------------

When developing web apps, the functionality gets complex quickly, both on the client and server side. You end up piling on some much functionality, maintaining and extending the software becomes nearly impossible if you haven't structured properly. Keeping code decoupled, properly-organized, and fully extensible is very time consuming, even with great project management. Without a framework promoting the use of good JS OOP coding patterns, the code can very quickly become a tangled mess!

Introduction to AirJS
---------------------------

Air JS makes web application development more realistic, organized, and clean. It's a command center where you can build the app from the ground up, call on resources that you've already built, and maintain a unified, organized, physical structure to your code.

Air JS facilitates a neat, object oriented, decoupled, "wireless" structure in web application engines and front-ends. 

The lightweight  framework facilitates maintainable code that is:

    - structured neatly within an Object Oriented design
    - decoupled, through Inversion of Control with Dependency Injection
    - wireless via Relational Awareness and The Observer pattern

The framework features some powerful built-in components, allowing the developer to focus on his own components rather than reinvent the wheel for each new app.

Whether you use the framework to facilitate the production of your functionality from scratch, call on some of the framework's powerful built-in components, or employ some external libraries, Air JS will ensure that it's all done in a structured, maintainable way.
